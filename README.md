# RayTerm Poster

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for RayTerm's poster, which was
presented at the [2019 Richard J. Cook -- Teresa M. Lahti Scholars Symposium](https://sites.allegheny.edu/research/scholars-symposium-2019/)
at Allegheny College.

The [**Better Poster Template**](https://github.com/rafaelbailo/betterposter-latex-template) is [Mike Morrison](https://twitter.com/mikemorrison)'s response to the traditional academic poster. In his own words:
> Every field in science uses the same, old, wall-of-text poster design. If we can improve the knowledge transfer efficiency of that design even by a little bit, it could have massive ripple effects on all of science.
>
> Also, poster sessions tend to suck, so here's my pitch to make them more efficient AND more fun with a new approach to designing scientific posters/academic posters that is both more usable, and easier to create!
